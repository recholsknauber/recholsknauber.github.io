EXIST CAFE - PDX
* MUSIC
** Internal database. I will work through music from:
*** Bandcamp
*** Spotify
*** YouTube
*** Soundcloud
*** Audius
** In the database I will give each album a rating from 1 to 5.
*** 5: Front page material.
*** 4: Easily accessed on the site, with some writing.
*** 3: Can be accessed on the site.
*** 2: Maybe for up-and-coming or things that seem promising, but may take a backseat based on how full site gets from 3-5.
*** 1: Likely not included, but worth tracking for some reason.
** The service I am providing customers:
*** Finding the best Portland music across many services, and describing it in an entertaining fashion.
*** EVENTS. Highlighting music events happening either in person or via the internet.
*** LONGER TERM: 
**** Connect with artists and labels.
**** Host events.
**** Record concerts.
**** Put on festivals.
** How to make money:
*** Begin with Google ads.
*** If site takes off, move toward making all ads local and vetted for quality.
*** Events.
